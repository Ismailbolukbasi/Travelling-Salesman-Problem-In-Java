# Travelling-Salesman-Problem-In-Java
-----------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------
In this project we solve Travelling Salesman Problem in java, you can learn more https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem
We solve this problem with five algorithms:
Arbitrary Insertion Algorithm,
Cheapest Insertion Algorithm,
Farthest Insertion Algorithm,
Nearest Insertion Algorithm and
Nearest Neighbor Algorithm.
Firstly, we define distances which we use , I define Turkish cities distances between each city , you can add, delete and modify distances. Then we determine the tour through algorithms
You can learn how algorithms work in "tsp-vrp" file.
